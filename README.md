# notion-archiver
Notion Archiver automates the archiving process of a specific notion page to a pre-determined github repository. When you paste a link of the notion page you want to archive in your github repo, this tool will automatically generate the markdown file of the page and prompt you to commit &amp; push the file to your repo.
